          <h5 className="description">Proper Diet Plan For Your child</h5>
          <p className="desc-para">
          For children between 5 to 6 years old, a balanced diet remains crucial to support their growth, development, and overall health. At this age, children are more active and have increased nutritional needs. Here's a general diet plan for children in this age range:<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5>Fruits and Vegetables:</h5><br></br>
          <ul>
            <li>Encourage your child to eat a variety of fruits and vegetables daily. Aim for at least 1.5 to 2 cups of fruits and 1.5 to 2.5 cups of vegetables per day..</li>
            <li>
            Offer a colorful array of fruits like berries, apples, oranges, and bananas, and vegetables such as carrots, broccoli, spinach, bell peppers, and tomatoes.
            </li>
          </ul>
        <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5> Grains:</h5><br></br>
          Include whole grains in your child's diet, such as whole wheat bread, brown rice, quinoa, oats, and whole grain pasta. Aim for about 5 to 7 ounces of grains per day, with at least half of them being whole grains.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5>Proteins:</h5><br></br>
          Offer lean sources of protein to support your child's growth and muscle development. Good options include poultry (chicken, turkey), lean cuts of beef or pork, fish, eggs, tofu, legumes (beans, lentils), and dairy products (milk, cheese, yogurt). Aim for about 4 to 6 ounces of protein-rich foods per day.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5>Dairy:</h5><br></br>
          Continue to include dairy products in your child's diet to meet their calcium needs for healthy bones and teeth. Offer options such as milk, cheese, yogurt, and fortified plant-based milk alternatives. Aim for about 2 to 3 servings of dairy per day.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5>Healthy Fats</h5><br></br>
          Incorporate sources of healthy fats into your child's diet, such as avocado, nuts (if there are no allergies), seeds (flaxseeds, chia seeds), nut butters, and olive oil. Healthy fats are important for brain development and overall health.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5>Snacks:</h5><br></br>
          Provide nutritious snacks to fuel your child's energy levels between meals. Opt for options like fresh fruit, cut-up vegetables with hummus or yogurt dip, whole grain crackers with cheese, homemade trail mix, or smoothies made with fruits and yogurt.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5>Hydration:</h5><br></br>
          Encourage your child to drink water regularly throughout the day to stay hydrated. Limit sugary drinks such as soda, fruit juices, and flavored milk.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5> Mealtime Tips:</h5><br></br>
          <ul>
            <li>Set regular meal and snack times to establish a routine for eating.</li>
            <li>Involve your child in meal planning and preparation to increase their interest in healthy foods.</li>
            <li>Be a positive role model by eating a variety of nutritious foods yourself.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Safety Considerations:</h5><br></br>
          <ul>
            <li>Continue to supervise your child during meal times to ensure they are eating safely and chewing their food thoroughly to prevent choking.</li>
            <li>Avoid offering foods that are choking hazards, such as whole grapes, nuts, popcorn, and hard candies.</li>
          </ul>
          <br></br>

          As always, consult with your child's pediatrician or a registered dietitian for personalized guidance and recommendations based on your child's individual needs, preferences, and any dietary restrictions or allergies they may have.
