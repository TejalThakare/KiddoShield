        <h5 className="description">Proper Diet Plan For Your child</h5>
        <p className="desc-para">
          For toddlers between 3 to 4 years old, their diet should continue to
          focus on providing a variety of nutritious foods to support their
          growth and development. At this age, toddlers are often more
          independent eaters but still require guidance and supervision to
          ensure they're getting a balanced diet. Here's a general diet plan for
          toddlers in this age range:<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5>Fruits and Vegetables:</h5>
          <br></br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Offer a variety of fruits and vegetables daily, aiming for at
              least 1 to 1.5 cups of each per day. Include a variety of colors
              and textures to ensure a wide range of nutrients.
            </li>
            <li>
              Examples include sliced apples, berries, bananas, oranges, steamed
              carrots, broccoli florets, bell pepper strips, and cucumber
              slices.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5> Grains:</h5>
          <br></br>
          Include whole grains in your toddler's diet, such as whole wheat
          bread, brown rice, quinoa, oatmeal, and whole grain pasta. Aim for
          about 3 to 5 servings of grains per day, depending on your child's
          appetite and activity level.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5>Proteins:</h5>
          <br></br>
          Offer lean sources of protein such as poultry (chicken, turkey), lean
          cuts of beef or pork, fish, eggs, tofu, legumes (beans, lentils), and
          dairy products (cheese, yogurt). Aim for about 2 to 3 servings of
          protein-rich foods per day.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5>Dairy:</h5>
          <br></br>
          Continue offering whole milk or switch to reduced-fat milk if
          recommended by your pediatrician. Aim for about 2 to 3 servings of
          dairy per day, including milk, cheese, and yogurt, to ensure your
          child gets enough calcium for healthy bones and teeth.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5>Healthy Fats</h5>
          <br></br>
          Include sources of healthy fats in your toddler's diet, such as
          avocado, nut butters (if there are no allergies), seeds (flaxseeds,
          chia seeds), and olive oil. Healthy fats are important for brain
          development and overall health.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5>Snacks:</h5>
          <br></br>
          Offer healthy snacks between meals to keep your toddler energized and
          satisfied. Good options include sliced fruits, cut-up vegetables,
          whole grain crackers, cheese cubes, yogurt, nuts, and homemade trail
          mix.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5>Hydration:</h5>
          <br></br>
          Encourage your toddler to drink water throughout the day to stay
          hydrated. Limit sugary drinks such as soda, fruit juices, and flavored
          milk, as they can contribute to tooth decay and provide empty
          calories.<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5> Mealtime Tips:</h5>
          <br></br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Involve your toddler in meal planning and preparation to encourage
              their interest in healthy eating.
            </li>
            <li>
              Offer a balanced mix of foods at each meal, including a protein
              source, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.
            </li>
            <li>
              Be patient and flexible. Toddlers may be picky eaters and may not
              always eat everything you offer. Offer a variety of nutritious
              options and let your child decide how much to eat.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Safety Considerations:</h5>
          <br></br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Avoid foods that are choking hazards, such as whole grapes, nuts,
              popcorn, and hard candies. Cut food into small, bite-sized pieces
              to reduce the risk of choking.
            </li>
            <li>
              Supervise your toddler during meal times to ensure they are eating
              safely and appropriately.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br></br>
          Remember to consult with your pediatrician for personalized guidance
          and recommendations based on your toddler's individual needs,
          preferences, and any dietary restrictions or allergies they may have.
