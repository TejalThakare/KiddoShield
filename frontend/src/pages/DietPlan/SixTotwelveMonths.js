        <h5 className="description">Proper Diet Plan For Your Baby</h5>
        <p className="desc-para">
          For babies between 6 to 12 months old, it's important to introduce a
          variety of nutritious foods to support their growth and development.
          Here's a general diet plan for a baby in this age range:<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5>Breast Milk or Formula:</h5>
          <br></br>
          Breast milk or formula should still be the primary source of nutrition
          for babies under one year old. Aim for about 24 to 32 ounces of breast
          milk or formula per day, or as recommended by your pediatrician.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <h5>Solid Foods:</h5>
          <br></br>
          Introduce solid foods gradually, one at a time, and watch for any
          signs of allergies or intolerances. Start with pureed or mashed foods
          and gradually move to more textured foods as your baby becomes more
          adept at chewing and swallowing.
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h5>Fruits and Vegetables: </h5>Offer a variety of pureed or
              mashed fruits and vegetables. Examples include mashed bananas,
              cooked and mashed sweet potatoes, pureed peas, carrots, and
              applesauce.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h5>Grains:</h5>Introduce iron-fortified cereals such as rice
              cereal, oatmeal, or barley cereal. You can mix these with breast
              milk, formula, or water to achieve the desired consistency.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h5>Proteins:</h5>Introduce pureed or mashed meats, poultry, fish,
              tofu, or legumes such as lentils or mashed beans. Make sure they
              are well-cooked and finely mashed or pureed for easier digestion.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h5>Dairy:</h5>Offer small amounts of plain, whole-milk yogurt or
              cottage cheese. Avoid cow's milk as a main drink until your baby
              is at least one year old.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h5>Feeding Shedule:</h5>
          <ol>
            <li>
              At this age, babies typically eat solids 2-3 times a day, along
              with breast milk or formula.
            </li>
            <li>
              Aim for feeding sessions to occur after breastfeeding or bottle
              feeding, not before.
            </li>
            <li>
              Allow your baby to guide you in terms of how much they want to
              eat. Let them explore different tastes and textures at their own
              pace.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h5>General Tips:</h5>
          <ol>
            <li>Always supervise your baby during feeding times.</li>
            <li>
              Avoid foods that are choking hazards, such as whole grapes, nuts,
              popcorn, and chunks of raw vegetables.
            </li>
            <li>
              Introduce new foods one at a time and wait a few days before
              introducing another new food. This helps you identify any
              potential allergies or intolerances.
            </li>
            <li>
              Make sure food is mashed or pureed to an appropriate consistency
              for your baby's age and stage of development.
            </li>
            <li>
              Offer water in a sippy cup with meals, especially once your baby
              starts eating more solids.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Remember, every baby is different, so it's important to consult with
            your pediatrician for personalized guidance and recommendations
            based on your baby's individual needs and development.
